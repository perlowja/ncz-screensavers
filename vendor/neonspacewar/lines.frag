/* lines.frag — fragment shader for the thick-stroke line renderer.
 *
 * Layout per-vertex (LineVert):
 *   x, y            world-space endpoint
 *   ox, oy          world-space other endpoint of the segment
 *   r, g, b         line colour
 *   a               alpha multiplier
 *   w               half-thickness in pixels
 *   s               side: -1 or +1 (perpendicular offset from line center)
 *
 * The vertex shader expands each segment into two triangles and
 * extrudes the four vertices by +-a_width*u_px_to_clip along the
 * segment's perpendicular, so the line ends up a thick stroked quad
 * with sub-pixel control.
 *
 * This fragment shader converts v_side (a -1..+1 "signed distance
 * to line center" expressed as the extrusion offset) into a sharp
 * bright core and a soft halo via exp(-d*d*k), without a blur pass.
 *
 * Default (when this file isn't found on disk and the inline shader
 * in src/gles3_neonspacewar.c is used) does the same.
