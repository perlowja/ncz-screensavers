/* ncz_gpu_tier.h — shared GPU capability detection + adaptive quality tier.
 *
 * Per the catalogue doctrine
 * (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-screensaver-family-doctrine.md),
 * every engine exposes a quality ladder that ADDS on strong hardware, not
 * only subtracts. Today the ladders are aspirational — pieces declare
 * tiers in documentation but render the same thing regardless. This
 * module is the runtime that backs those tiers.
 *
 * Two stages:
 *   1. Static prior from GL_RENDERER/VENDOR/VERSION + a couple of cheap
 *      GL limits. This is a STARTING tier — never the answer. "Intel
 *      UHD Graphics" spans many generations with very different
 *      throughput, and the same GPU performs differently at 1080p and
 *      4K. A renderer string is a hint, not a measurement.
 *   2. Runtime measurement via rolling-median frame time. The engine
 *      calls ncz_gpu_tier_record_frame_ms() each draw; the module
 *      compares against the target budget (~16.7ms / 60fps) and adapts
 *      tier with hysteresis.
 *
 * Hysteresis:
 *   - Warm up: ignore the first ~30 frames (shader compile, cache
 *     populate, first-draw costs). A cold frame is not representative.
 *   - Track a rolling median, not a mean — a single hitch should not
 *     move the tier.
 *   - Asymmetric thresholds: downgrade readily when over budget,
 *     upgrade only when comfortably under it.
 *   - Rate-limit changes; never oscillate.
 *   - Settle: once we have been running for a minute, never upgrade.
 *
 * Override:
 *   NCZ_GPU_TIER=low|medium|high|ultra|auto (default auto).
 *   Used for reproducible captures and for tier-comparison evidence.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   in init_cb, once GL is current:
 *     ncz_gpu_tier_init();                      reads override + queries GL hints
 *   each frame in draw_cb:
 *     double dt_ms = ncz_now() - prev;
 *     ncz_gpu_tier_record_frame_ms(dt_ms);
 *     const ncz_gpu_tier_t *t = ncz_gpu_tier_current();
 *     read t->tier, t->scalar, t->name, t->reason for knobs
 *   once on shutdown (optional):
 *     ncz_gpu_tier_shutdown();
