# NVIDIA GLES3 full-matrix follow-up — CERBERUS — 2026-09-25

This follow-up closes the previously untested NVIDIA vendor path identified in
[the full O6N/PEGASUS matrix](FULL-MATRIX-2026-09-25.md). It records a complete
140/140 run on CERBERUS using a real NVIDIA RTX 4500 Ada Generation and driver
595.58.03. The compositor and every client reported NVIDIA, not Mesa or llvmpipe.

## Outcome

The fail-closed harness result is **0 PASS / 140 FAIL**: 139 targets animated or
rendered long enough for both captures and then exited 139 during SIGTERM cleanup;
`splitflap_gles3` retained its distinct exit 134 behavior. Before shutdown, the
two real `grim` captures classify as **100 animated / 35 black / 5 static**.
These visual results are reported separately and are not promoted to PASS because
a target that crashes during normal harness shutdown does not satisfy the matrix bar.

The authoritative per-target machine-readable ledger is
[`results-with-visual.tsv`](../validation/full_matrix_2026-09-25/cerberus/results-with-visual.tsv).
It retains the original harness status/failure columns and adds `visual_result`.

## Hardware and method

| Item | CERBERUS result |
|---|---|
| Architecture | x86_64 |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 4500 Ada Generation |
| Driver / client GL | 595.58.03 / OpenGL ES 3.2 NVIDIA 595.58.03 |
| Client renderer | NVIDIA RTX 4500 Ada Generation/PCIe/SSE2 (140/140 logs and TSV rows) |
| Compositor | Debian labwc 0.8.3 / wlroots 0.18.2, user-local package extraction |
| Output | wlroots headless `HEADLESS-1`, 1280×720, `wayland-0` |
| Compositor renderer | NVIDIA EGL 1.5, NVIDIA GLES 3.2, RTX 4500 Ada |
| Source/build | native Meson/Ninja build from `9b617c0`; 140 targets |
| Capture | `validation/run-full-matrix.sh`; two real `grim` shots two seconds apart |
| Coverage | 140/140 targets, 280/280 captures |

There was no attached physical display. labwc was run with the wlroots headless
backend and GLES2 renderer pinned to `/dev/dri/renderD128` and GLVND's NVIDIA
vendor manifest. The login lacked `render` membership, so access to that single
render node was temporarily widened for the run and restored afterward. The
packaged Xwayland scratch directory was bind-mounted from `~/build-tmp/` in a
private mount namespace; no test/build data was placed on the host's `/tmp`.

## NVIDIA-specific evidence

This run exposes a broad NVIDIA-only shutdown failure. All 139 non-`splitflap`
targets reach both captures, then SIGSEGV during shared cleanup. A representative
GDB reproduction on animated `antinspect_gles3` resolves that target's stack to:

```text
#0  NVIDIA/GL dispatch target (no symbols)
#1  ncz_gles3_runtime_fini at src/gles3_compat.c:545
#2  app_fini at src/gles3_harness.c:478
#3  atexit_app_fini at src/gles3_harness.c:513
```

Line 545 is `glDeleteBuffers(1, &g_rt.scratch_vbo)`. This is materially different
from the prior Mesa-based matrix, where normal harness termination did not produce
a universal SIGSEGV. The evidence establishes the NVIDIA association and exact call
site; it does not by itself prove whether the defect belongs to the driver, GLVND
dispatch, or the harness's context/cleanup ordering.

Three targets are additionally black on CERBERUS while animated on the prior
PEGASUS/Mesa run: `cube21`, `fieldlines`, and `lattice`. `mapscroller` is also
black versus animated on PEGASUS, but its stderr says `mapscroller.pl` is absent
from the current checkout, so it is categorized as a content/init issue rather
than NVIDIA-specific. `unicrud` likewise reports `no characters found`.

`flurry` is black and logs `glGenerateMipmap failed (0x501)` on NVIDIA. This is
concrete NVIDIA-path evidence, but the target was also black on both Mesa platforms,
so it is not claimed as NVIDIA-exclusive.
