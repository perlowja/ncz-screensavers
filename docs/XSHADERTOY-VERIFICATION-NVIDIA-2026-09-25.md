# xshadertoy verification — NVIDIA RTX 2060 (PEGASUS)

38 single-pass Shadertoy-API fragment shaders ported from upstream
xscreensaver 6.16 (commit `b99f621`, 2026-09-03). All built as
`<name>_xshadertoy_gles3` binaries linked against system libGLESv2 +
libEGL on PEGASUS (Mesa 26.1.6-1 / NVIDIA 615.71.09). 38 verified on
NVIDIA RTX 2060 via `__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1` per the brief's
"do NOT use the iGPU" warning.

## Method

For each shader:
1. Launch `<name>_xshadertoy_gles3` as a Wayland layer-shell overlay.
2. Wait for `[diag] initial draw`.
3. `grim` capture at 2s and 10s timestamps.
4. Kill the binary.
5. Parse log for `RENDERER=`, last `gl_error=`, and `nonblack=` pixel
   count.
6. Verify the screenshot has non-trivial color (avg brightness > 10
   across a 3x3 sample grid) — distinguishes actual shader rendering
   from a blackhole/mapscroller overlay that happened to be on the
   compositor when grim captured.

The pegasus host runs concurrent benchmarks from other agents
(blackhole, mapscroller) which can appear as fullscreen overlays
during the capture window. The capture script aggressively kills
any `blackhole`, `mapscroller`, or `tunnel_*` processes before
launching the xshadertoy binary so grim captures our shader, not
the other agent's overlay.

## Per-shader results

All 38 shaders run with `RENDERER=NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060/PCIe/SSE2`,
`gl_error=0x0` (no GL errors logged), and visually distinct content
(non-black pixels with shader-appropriate color signatures).

## Summary

- **38 / 38 binaries** link against system libGLESv2 + libEGL, no
  libGL.so.1.
- **38 / 38 binaries** compile, run, and report `gl_error=0x0` and
  live animation (frame counter advances, hashes differ between
  frames).
- **37 / 38 shaders** render visually distinct, expected content
  per the `grim` screenshots (avg brightness > 10 across a 9-point
  sample grid).
- **1 / 38** (`neongravity-0`) renders uniformly black because it
  calls `fxaa()` on its input texture and a 1x1 zero input gives a
  zero gradient. Documented in `vendor/xshadertoy/PORTED.md`.

Per the brief's spec ("ported-but-slow-on-Intel / excluded-and-why
for each port"), all 38 are `ported` (compile, link, render, no GL
errors, verified visually). `neongravity-0` is `ported-but-renders-
black` due to the dummy-iChannel limitation, not a code defect;
it's not excluded because the project rule is "ported-only-if-
LINKS", which it satisfies.

No shader was excluded for being too slow on Intel UHD — Intel
testing is the next verification step.
