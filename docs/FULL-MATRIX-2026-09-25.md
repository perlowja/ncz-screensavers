# Full GLES3 hardware matrix — 2026-09-25

> **NVIDIA follow-up:** The complete 140-target CERBERUS / RTX 4500 Ada run is
> documented in [NVIDIA-FULL-MATRIX-CERBERUS-2026-09-25.md](NVIDIA-FULL-MATRIX-CERBERUS-2026-09-25.md),
> including real two-shot `grim` evidence and a universal NVIDIA-path cleanup
> SIGSEGV that keeps the fail-closed result at 0 PASS / 140 FAIL.

This is the complete current build set: **140/140 targets on O6N arm64** and
**140/140 targets on PEGASUS amd64**. After the focused fixes recorded below,
the current totals are 105 PASS / 35 FAIL on O6N and 110 PASS / 30 FAIL on
PEGASUS. No target is marked N/A. PASS means two
real `grim` captures taken two seconds apart were non-black and differed by
more than 1,000 pixels while the process remained alive. Exit code alone is
not accepted. FAIL targets are set aside below with their observed mode.

## Hardware and method

| Host | Architecture | Renderer | Build | Coverage | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| O6N | arm64 | Mali-G720-Immortalis | native ULTRA arm64 at `251bf22` + focused fixes | 140/140 | 105 PASS / 35 FAIL |
| PEGASUS | amd64 | Mesa Intel UHD Graphics CML GT2 (the active compositor GPU; not RTX 2060) | fresh native Meson/Ninja build + focused fixes | 140/140 | 110 PASS / 30 FAIL |

Each target has stderr, an exit-code file, two 480px evidence thumbnails,
metrics, and SHA-256 hashes of the retained full-resolution captures under
`validation/full_matrix_2026-09-25/{o6n,pegasus}/`. The full-resolution PNGs
remain on each named host at `~/gles3-validation/full-matrix-2026-09-25/shots/`
(176 MiB O6N; 129 MiB PEGASUS); thumbnails are checked in to keep the repo
reviewable. Both runs dynamically discovered `/run/user/1000/wayland-0`.

The initial O6N attempt inherited an obsolete broad `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` from
the 2026-09-23 sweep and produced allocator corruption. That harness defect
was removed and the O6N matrix was restarted from target 1; only the clean
140-row rerun is reported here.

## Set aside for focused fixing

### O6N arm64

- **black** — process and frame diagnostics continued, but both real captures were black: `chompytower`, `cube21`, `cubicgrid`, `cyclone`, `euphoria`, `fieldlines`, `fliptext`, `flocks`, `flurry`, `flux`, `glblur`, `glcells`, `gltext`, `headroom`, `helios`, `hyperspace`, `implicitdemo`, `jigsaw`, `lattice`, `menger`, `microcosm`, `photopile`, `plasma`, `providence`, `skulloop`, `skyrocket`, `solarwinds`, `splitflap`, `splodesic`, `timetunnel`.
- **exit_1** — initialization rejected required content/configuration; see per-target stderr: `unicrud`.
- **static** — visible output was captured, but the two frames did not change materially: `atlantis`, `highvoltage`, `quasicrystal`, `sballs`.

### PEGASUS amd64

- **black** — process and frame diagnostics continued, but both real captures were black: `chompytower`, `cubicgrid`, `cyclone`, `euphoria`, `fliptext`, `flocks`, `flurry`, `flux`, `glblur`, `glcells`, `gltext`, `headroom`, `helios`, `hyperspace`, `implicitdemo`, `menger`, `microcosm`, `photopile`, `plasma`, `providence`, `skulloop`, `skyrocket`, `solarwinds`, `timetunnel`.
- **exit_1** — initialization rejected required content/configuration; see per-target stderr: `unicrud`.
- **exit_134** — process aborted after initial frames; see splitflap stderr: `splitflap`.
- **static** — visible output was captured, but the two frames did not change materially: `atlantis`, `highvoltage`, `quasicrystal`, `sballs`.

## Interpretation constraints

- Black/static classification is deliberately fail-closed. Some savers can
  have slow or dark phases, but the directive requires confirmed animation;
  these targets therefore remain FAIL until a focused longer/manual run proves
  otherwise.
- PEGASUS is genuine amd64 hardware, but its active labwc session renders on
  the Intel UHD 630-class iGPU. The installed RTX 2060 was not the compositor
  GPU, so this ledger does not claim NVIDIA coverage.
- MEDUSA was attempted first but was unreachable (`No route to host`); PEGASUS
  supplied the complete amd64 matrix instead.

## Focused fixes after the full run

- `unknownpleasures_gles3`: restored the application-wide XScreenSaver
  `Foreground`/`Background` resource defaults in the standalone compatibility
  layer. Real 2s/4s `grim` captures prove animation on both O6N and PEGASUS;
  see `validation/full_matrix_fixes_2026-09-25/unknownpleasures/`.
- `bouncingcow_gles3`, `cubenetic_gles3`, `hextrail_gles3`,
  `skytentacles_gles3`, and `winduprobot_gles3`: populated standard xlockmore `ModeInfo` fields from
  each hack's parsed defaults. All four now pass real 2s/4s animation checks
  on both architectures; see
  `validation/full_matrix_fixes_2026-09-25/mode-defaults/`.
