# tools/bh-sweep.sh — per-launch capture sweep on PEGASUS.
#
# Runs N seeded launches of blackhole_gles3, each captured to its own
# per-launch directory with the [diag] stderr beside the PNGs. Frames
# 4, 60, 120, 180 land (≈3s of runtime at 60fps) which is enough to
# see the trajectory change visibly between frames.
#
# Usage (run ON pegasus):
#   bash tools/bh-sweep.sh <runs_root> <seed1> [<seed2> ...]
#
# Output layout per launch:
#   <runs_root>/launch_<seed>/
#       launch.stderr        # [diag] lines including the launch params
#       frame_00000004.png   # ~t=0.067s
#       frame_0000003c.png   # ~t=1.0s
#       frame_00000078.png   # ~t=2.0s
#       frame_000000b4.png   # ~t=3.0s
#
# Cleanup gate at the end verifies nothing is left running.
